# Pre-Conditions

### Create Secret for Proxmox Password

Create a file secrets.tfvars in the base directory of this repo:

```sh
#secrets.tfvars content
proxmox_password = "XXXXXXX"
```

### Generate SSH Keys

Create new set of SSH keys if you don't already have a key pair you want to use:

```sh
# Generate a new key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_proxmox_vm

# Ensure the SSH agent is running
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your private key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_proxmox_vm
```

### Update Variables

The content of variables.tf will need to be updated

üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines (vms)
A map of VM configurations, allowing fine-tuned control of each instance.

- vmid (number): Unique VM identifier.
- ipv4_address (string): IPv4 address (e.g., dhcp).
- ipv4_gateway (string): IPv4 gateway address.
- cores (number): Number of CPU cores assigned.
- dedicated_memory (number): Dedicated memory in MB.
- floating_memory (number): Floating memory in MB.
- scsi0_size_gb (number): Disk size for the primary SCSI storage (GB).
- scsi1_size_gb (number): Disk size for the secondary SCSI storage (GB).

Note: I found that I had to downgrade the bgp provider and set the VMIDs statically due to this
issue: https://github.com/bpg/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/1610.

#### Memory Type Differences

1. Dedicated Memory (dedicated)
   Represents the guaranteed amount of RAM allocated to the VM.
   Acts as the minimum memory assigned to the VM, ensuring it always has this much available.
   If set equal to floating, then memory ballooning is disabled (the VM always gets a fixed amount of RAM).
2. Floating Memory (floating)
   Defines the maximum memory the VM can use.
   Enables ballooning, which allows the VM to dynamically adjust its memory usage based on demand and availability.
   If greater than dedicated, Proxmox can reclaim unused memory and reallocate it to other VMs.

# Adding a new Host üî•

The hosts that are deployed is driven be the variable `vms` found in `variables.tf`. To add a host update this data structure.

```js
  default = {

    "docker-compose-server" = {
      vmid            = 1006, ipv4_address = "dhcp", ipv4_gateway = "", cores = 2, dedicated_memory = 8192,
      floating_memory = 2048, scsi0_size_gb = 10, scsi1_size_gb = 0
    }
  }
```

# Execute Terraform

To deploy the template execute the Terraform

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan -var-file="secrets.tfvars"
terraform apply -var-file="secrets.tfvars" --auto-approve
```

# Accessing Servers

The created hosts will be available on the local network via `<hostname>.local` where the hostname is the key in the vms map. Your public key (setup as a pre-condition) is automatically added to each host.

```
 ‚ûú  proxmox-infrastructure git:(main) ‚úó ssh ubuntu@docker-compose-server.local
The authenticity of host 'docker-compose-server.local (fe80::be24:11ff:fed9:998d%en0)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:i+/+M6AoSc0qpJQjMs47hjg2FokkD6qaQrJAP4xXXXX.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'docker-compose-server.local' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

## SSH Errors

If you have previously associated the hostname with a host key, key verification will fail:

```sh
# Host key for docker-compose-server.local has changed and you have requested strict checking.
# Host key verification failed.
```

Remove the ssh key from hosts.

```sh
# Host key for docker-compose-server.local has changed and you have requested strict checking.
# Host key verification failed.

ssh-keygen -R docker-compose-server.local
```

# Design Notes ü§ì

## **Disk and Mount Configuration Summary**

This Terraform configuration provisions a **Proxmox virtual machine** with the following disk and mount setup:

### **Disks Created**

1. **Primary Disk (`scsi0`)**

   - **Purpose:** Boot disk containing the **Ubuntu cloud image**.
   - **Size:** Defined in `each.value.scsi0_size_gb`.
   - **Source:** Downloads the cloud image from `var.cloud_image`.
   - **Filesystem:** Determined by the Ubuntu cloud image.
   - **Storage Location:** Stored in `var.storage`.

2. **Secondary Disk (`scsi1`)**

   - **Purpose:** Additional data storage.
   - **Size:** Defined in `each.value.scsi1_size_gb`.
   - **Format:** **Raw disk** (`file_format = "raw"`).
   - **Storage Location:** Stored in `var.storage`.
   - **Filesystem:** Initially unformatted, but configured in **Cloud-Init**.

3. **EFI Disk (`efi_disk`)**
   - **Purpose:** Required for UEFI boot.
   - **Storage Location:** Stored in `var.storage`.
   - **Size:** Managed automatically by Proxmox.

---

### **Mount Configuration**

The **Cloud-Init script** (`user_data_cloud_config.yaml`) includes a setup to configure the secondary disk (`/dev/sdb`):

1. **Checks for the existence of `/dev/sdb`** (Secondary Disk).
2. **Formats the disk** with the following setup:
   - **Partition Table:** GPT
   - **Partition Type:** Primary
   - **Filesystem:** ext4
3. **Creates a mount point at `/mnt/data`**.
4. **Updates `/etc/fstab`** to persist the mount across reboots.
5. **Mounts the disk automatically** at `/mnt/data`.

---

### **Key Notes**

‚úÖ The **primary disk (`scsi0`)** is used for the OS and booting.  
‚úÖ The **secondary disk (`scsi1`)** is configured for additional storage and auto-mounted at `/mnt/data`.  
‚úÖ **EFI disk** is required for UEFI-based VM booting.  
‚úÖ **Cloud-Init ensures secondary disk is formatted and mounted** on first boot.

This setup provides a **clean separation between the OS and additional storage**, ensuring flexibility for future disk expansions.

## Why Install mDNS (Avahi) on Your Server?

Installing mDNS (Multicast DNS), facilitated by the Avahi Daemon, allows your server to broadcast its hostname and
services seamlessly across your local network without requiring a central DNS server or manual IP address configuration.
This makes it incredibly easy for devices like macOS, Windows, and Linux machines to discover and connect to your server
using a simple hostname (your-hostname.local) instead of remembering complex IP addresses. With mDNS, services such as
SSH, HTTP, Samba, and printer sharing become instantly accessible to other devices on the same network. Whether you're
running a home server, a development environment, or a lightweight local cloud setup, mDNS significantly simplifies
connectivity, reduces configuration overhead, and improves usability across diverse devices.

mDNS ensures that hostnames are automatically registered on the local network e.g. on the client Mac:

```sh
ssh ubuntu@docker-compose-server.local
```

## **Ignoring Cloud Image Updates in Terraform to Prevent VM Recreation**

### **Why Ignoring `disk[0].file_id` is Necessary**

In this Terraform Proxmox configuration, a **cloud image** is downloaded and attached to VMs as their primary disk (`scsi0`). The issue arises when the cloud image (`proxmox_virtual_environment_download_file.ubuntu_cloud_image`) is **updated or changed**.

If Terraform detects a change in `file_id` (which happens when the image URL is updated), it will trigger a **recreation** of all VMs using this image. This is undesirable because:

- **Terraform will attempt to destroy and recreate most VMs**, leading to unnecessary downtime.
- **Existing workloads could be lost** if not backed up.
- **Cloud-init customization may have to be reapplied**, disrupting services.

### **How Terraform Handles Changes to the Cloud Image**

#### **Without `ignore_changes = [disk[0].file_id]`**

- Terraform sees the cloud image update as a fundamental infrastructure change.
- It **marks all dependent VMs for destruction and recreation**.
- This can cause **unnecessary downtime and data loss**.

#### **With `ignore_changes = [disk[0].file_id]`**

- Terraform **ignores changes** to the `file_id` of the first disk (`scsi0`).
- The **VMs remain running**, and Terraform does **not trigger unnecessary recreations**.
- This allows you to update the cloud image **without impacting existing VMs**.

### **Terraform Configuration**

The following `lifecycle` rule ensures Terraform does not track changes to the base image:

```hcl
lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [disk[0].file_id]
}
```
